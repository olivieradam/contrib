This model code was taken from Michael Birkin's java recreation of the
Amiga juggler demo. I just ported some of the model generation code from
java to c. The link to Michael's page is here:

It's just an OpenGL implementation of the ray tracing demo. Real time using
polygon models and lighting as opposed to ray tracing, that's why there
are no reflections or shadows. It was just a quick hack after all...
